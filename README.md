## How It Works
EcoPrompt uses published model energy benchmarks to estimate power consumption per prompt. When you submit a query, it analyzes token length, model type, and processing complexity to calculate your estimated energy use.
Then, it suggests a simpler, lower-energy version of your prompt without losing meaning.

All data stays local to your browser — **no user information is collected or stored.**
